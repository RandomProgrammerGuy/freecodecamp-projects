# freecodecamp-projects
A library of all of my FreeCodeCamp projects. 

# What this is?
FreeCodeCamp requires you to do specific practices in order to give you certifications for different programming related tasks. I'm storing all of the ones related to me here.

# Can I use this code myself?
Use is completely allowed for all business and/or personal **unless that use is for doing FreeCodeCamp's projects, in which case use of code in this repository is unethical and against FreeCodeCamp policy**. According to the *FreeCodeCamp Academic Honesty Policy*, all code in your projects has to be written by yourself or by someone completing the course alongside you at the same time.
