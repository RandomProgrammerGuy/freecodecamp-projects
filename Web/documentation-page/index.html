                During her rather short career, Eilish has managed to set multiple records such as the youngest artist to win
                the four main Grammys and youngest artist to ever win the Brit Awards. Predictions show that she'll continue 
                to grow in the coming years and will become one of the most well known artists of the century.

                Eilish was born on Dec. 18 2001 in the city of Los Angeles, California. Her mother <i>Maggie Baird O' Connell</i>
                is a teacher, screenwriter and actress. Her father <i>Patric O' Connell</i> is a part-time actor, appearing in

                Eilish and her older brother <i>Finneas Baird O' Connell</i> were both homeschooled. Finneas learnt the basics of songwriting
                during that period from their mother. Eilish has previously stated that his brother inspired her to go into music. She wrote
                songs at an very early age. Her first "real" song was written when she was 11. Titled <i>"Fingers Crossed"</i>, the song was 
                inspired by the television series <i>The Walking Dead</i>. Eilish also performed at the Los Angeles Children's Choir when she
                was young.
